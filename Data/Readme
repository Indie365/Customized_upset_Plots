These are 4 different small RNA datasets. 
Data from [Li et al. 2020. Genome Research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31896557) 

* 1st column = genome location. This is what we'll find intersection for.
* 2nd column = their small RNA relative abundance (expression), in units of RPM.
* last column = cell type.
